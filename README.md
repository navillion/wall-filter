# wall-filter
A ROBLOX Group wall filtering bot to auto-delete scams and other spam messages, while reporting what was deleted to a Discord webhook.

To set up, create a .ENV file / update your secrets to contain your `group` (group wall you want moderated), `cookie` (.ROBLOSECURITY), `webhook` (discord webhook link).

# Cookie Setup
1. Create a secondary ROBLOX account and join your group.
2. Give this account Read/Delete permissions to allow it to manage your group wall
3. Copy and paste your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie into the .ENV/secrets
